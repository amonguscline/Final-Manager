This is a comment that explains how an object is constructed in Java.
To construct an object in Java, you must first define a class that represents the object you want to create. This class should include attributes and behaviors that are specific to the object. For example, if you want to create a "Dog" object, you might define a "Dog" class with attributes like breed, size, and color, and behaviors like barking and wagging its tail.
Once you have defined the class, you can create an instance of that class by using the "new" keyword and calling the class's constructor method. This will allocate memory for the new object and allow you to manipulate it using the methods and attributes defined in the class. For example, you might create a new "Dog" object like this:
Dog myDog = new Dog();
This will create a new "Dog" object and assign it to the variable "myDog". You can then call methods on the object to make it perform its defined behaviors, or access and modify its attributes to change its state.
In summary, to construct an object in Java, you must first define a class that represents the object, and then use the "new" keyword and the class's constructor method to create an instance of that class.

    //that was written by an ai to explain what this code does because i'm too lazy to explain it. tl;dr this makes a studymanager object. woo
    StudyManager s = new StudyManager();
  }
